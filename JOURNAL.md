## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Installed KiCad and the required libraries  

I have successfully installed kicad and the necessary libraries needed to work on this project. It took a lot of trial and error to get it but in the end I have figured out how to add those necessary libraries.

I am thinking of making a number pad that can connect both wirelessly and wired. (It may also be part of my bigger project which I am not going to spoil here.)

## 10/19/2025 5 PM - Made schematics V`1  

I made the first iteration of the schematic.

I think it looks cool and I tried to make it organized like what you see in the image. I had to experiment a bit to find where the blue rectangles from the guide come from and I think those were great additions to my schematic page.

## 10/19/2025 6 PM - Assigned Footprints  

Assigned all of the footprints.

I wish if the guide provided more information on which key switch was used and why. The guide says "chalk hot swap sockets from marbastlib", but when I checked I didn't find any switch called "chalk" in the repository. I couldn't also get the footprints from marbastlib to appear in the footprint selection tab so I spent a lot of time there. I finally decided to go with the default Keyboard switches in KiCad, "Cherry_MX" which I think would work.
