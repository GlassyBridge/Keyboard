## 10/19/2025 - Installed KiCad and the required libraries  

I have successfully installed kicad and the necessary libraries needed to work on this project. It took a lot of trial and error to get it but in the end I have figured out how to add those necessary libraries.

I am thinking of making a number pad that can connect both wirelessly and wired. (It may also be part of my bigger project which I am not going to spoil here.)
