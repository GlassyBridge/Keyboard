## 10/19/2025 2 PM - Installed KiCad and the required libraries  

I have successfully installed kicad and the necessary libraries needed to work on this project. It took a lot of trial and error to get it but in the end I have figured out how to add those necessary libraries.

I am thinking of making a number pad that can connect both wirelessly and wired. (It may also be part of my bigger project which I am not going to spoil here.)

## 10/19/2025 5 PM - Made schematics V`1  

I made the first iteration of the schematic.

I think it looks cool and I tried to make it organized like what you see in the image. I had to experiment a bit to find where the blue rectangles from the guide come from and I think those were great additions to my schematic page.

## 10/19/2025 6 PM - Assigned Footprints  

Assigned all of the footprints.

I wish if the guide provided more information on which key switch was used and why. The guide says "chalk hot swap sockets from marbastlib", but when I checked I didn't find any switch called "chalk" in the repository. I couldn't also get the footprints from marbastlib to appear in the footprint selection tab so I spent a lot of time there. I finally decided to go with the default Keyboard switches in KiCad, "Cherry_MX" which I think would work.

## 10/23/2025 - Researched ALOT  

I wanted to have a MagSafe (or magnetic connections) between my keyboard modules and looked into various types of connections. I finally settled on using magnetic pogo-pins and decided to use a 6 pin connector for power and I2C connections between modules. I am now facing issues because I now need 6 total free pins (including power, SDA, SCL, and other two GPIO pins for other extra needs). I am thinking of rewiring my KeyMatrix in order to have some free pins.

## 10/26/2025 11 AM - Decided to use an IO Expander  

I decided to use an IO expander for my keyboard matrix. I couldn't find one with 9 pins so I chose to use the default one given in the symbol library of KiCad. I think this project is getting complex day by day and I hope I finish it.

## 10/26/2025 3 PM - (Hopefully) Finished the Schematic  

I have separated the key matrix connection into an MCP23017 and set it to communicate with the XIAO through SDA and SCL pins. Using the leftover pins I connected them to the module connectors so I can use them to transfer information between the main board (or other modules) and the keypad module. I may add LEDs to this but since I am planning to give the main board RGB LEDs, I am going to give this module only back light (possibly white) LEDs that may have dimming properties.

## 10/26/2025 5 PM - Started working on the PCB layout  

I was arranging the key switches after finishing my schematic. I noticed that my keys weren't similar to the ones being used in the tutorial (because I liked how they looked). Now my layout is messed so so I am trying to find KiCad shortcuts that make this process faster.

## 10/26/2025 6 PM - Arranged the Key Switches  

I have arranged the key switches aligned with 1mm grid. This took a lot of time because when you try to move the footprints together, the X or Y positions misalign from the grid. I don't think there is a fix for this so ig I'll have to work with it.
